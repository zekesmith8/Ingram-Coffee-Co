          Woman spends too much time on Codepens despite advice; no plans to

          <p>
            Sometimes, Internet users land themselves in an uncommon situation
            where an app or website can be used for both work and personal
            situations. Well, a young front-end designer was spending up to 13
            hours on the site, Codepen for work and her hobby, which
            unfortunately, is also coding.
          </p>
          <p>
            The designer, whose work includes a <em>To-Do Terrarium</em>,
            clarified, "Well, I didn't <em> have </em>to use it for work but it
            was already part of my workflow. It just made sense as it was more
            efficient." The biggest issue, she said, is that she would hop on
            Codepen for work, but would get distracted by pens made by others in
            the community for unexpectedly long periods of time, which then
            causes her to spend even more time on the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I mean, that's terrible right?" she asked. Codepen, which brands
            itself as the best place to build, test, and discover front-end
            code, has declined to comment at this time.

              Making a floor Plan with CSS Grid? Talk about using the wrong tool
              for the job. But I guess this is what happens when someone isn't
              happy with any of the floor plans found on Pinterest; she'll start
              making her own for the eventual home that she will never own.
              Nevertheless, there's a home office with a large window to look
              out of pensively during rainy days and a ton of "white space" for
              the cats to run around.

            'media card zen garden'. Each pen comes with five (yes, five) color
